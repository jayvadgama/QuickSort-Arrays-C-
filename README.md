# QuickSort-Arrays-C-
The program creates an array of user defined length and content. Quicksort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the two resulting subarrays. This algorithm is quite efficient for large-sized data sets as its average and worst-case complexity are O(n2), respectively.


QuickSort is a powerful sorting algorithm used to sort arrays of any length and content with incredible speed. 
This program implements the QuickSort algorithm, allowing users to quickly and easily sort arrays of integers, characters, or any other data type. 
Simply input your array and watch as QuickSort rapidly sorts it into ascending or descending order.
